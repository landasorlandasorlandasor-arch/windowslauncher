/**
 * Hands a Windows Phone 8.1 setup to the launcher that inherited it.
 *
 * Reads only the copy [WP8Migration] set aside - never the live preferences - so what the
 * phone launcher receives is the arrangement as it stood before this app swept its own
 * retired programs out of it.
 *
 * Guarded by a signature-level permission, so the only app that can read it is one signed
 * with the same key. That is the whole of the access control: there is no user consent
 * prompt here, because the two apps are the same author's and the data never leaves the
 * device.
 *
 * Two things worth knowing:
 *
 * - It takes the copy itself if nobody has yet. A provider can be the first thing in this
 *   process to run - the phone launcher may be asking before the desktop has been opened
 *   even once since it updated - and without this the answer would be an empty directory.
 *   [WP8Migration.captureIfNeeded] is idempotent, so calling it here costs nothing when
 *   the copy already exists.
 * - It serves files, not rows. The snapshot is a JSON file plus a directory of icons and a
 *   background image, and [query] exists only to list what is there so the reader knows
 *   what to ask for.
